# ADB No Cable [ROOT]
## Allows you to debug over Wi-Fi without ever connecting a USB cable.

Get from Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bytasaur.adbnocableroot

I've tried to keep it minimal but useful.
- There's separate buttons for enabling and disabling ADB over Wi-Fi.
- A status display with a refresh button.
- A very useful ip address display with a refresh button to help you connect.

### On your phone:
Open app > Click Enable > Allow root access</br>

### On your PC:
run `adb connect [IP]`</br>
